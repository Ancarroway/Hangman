# Hangman Game

## Description
This is a fun **command-line Hangman game** where players guess letters to complete a word.  
Players can choose from multiple categories, receive hints, and even try to **solve the word** directly.

## Features
- Multiple word categories to choose from.
- Hangman ASCII art updates after each wrong guess.
- Input validation to prevent invalid or repeated guesses.
- Hint system (one hint per game).
- **New:** Option to "solve" the entire word in one guess.
- Scoring system based on remaining attempts.
- Ability to play multiple rounds.

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `hangman_game.py`.
2. Run the game using:
```
python hangman_game.py
```
3. Follow the prompts to select a category, guess letters, or solve the word.

## Example Output
```
ðŸŽ® Welcome to Hangman! (Category: Animals)

Remaining attempts: 6
Guess a letter, type 'hint' for a hint, or type 'solve' to guess the full word: e
